Practiced array manipulation using both methods and loops. Implemented reusable functions such as countEven, countOdd, tenToOne, and printTriangle to reinforce logic building. Explored the spread operator for cloning and updating arrays, and integrated buttons to trigger these functions interactively. Focused on writing clean, general-purpose utilities for better reusability and modularity.
